## 🎯 Overview
The goal of this project is to recognize doodles (simple hand-drawn sketches) by training a neural network built entirely from mathematical principles. The project demonstrates:
- Fundamental concepts of neural networks 🧩
- Matrix operations for forward and backward propagation ➗✖️
- Optimization techniques like gradient descent 📉

## 🚀 Features
- **Custom Neural Network:** Built from scratch using only Java and mathematics. 🛠️
- **Adjustable Layers:** Configurable number of layers and neurons. 🎛️
- **Training and Testing:** Supports training on a dataset and testing with unseen doodles. 🖼️
- **No Dependencies:** No external machine learning libraries; only Java's standard libraries are used. ✅

## 🛠 Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 11 or later ☕
- **Dataset:** A dataset of doodles in a compatible format (e.g., CSV with pixel values and labels) 📊

## 📥 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/doodle-recognition-nn.git
   cd doodle-recognition-nn
   ```
2. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac -d out src/**/*.java
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java -cp out Main
   ```

## 🖥️ Usage
1. **Prepare Dataset:** Ensure your doodle dataset is formatted correctly (e.g., pixel data as inputs and labels as outputs). 📝
2. **Training:** Train the neural network by running the program and specifying the training dataset. 🏋️‍♂️
3. **Testing:** Test the trained network with new doodles to evaluate performance. 🎯

### Example
```bash
java -cp out Main train dataset/train.csv
java -cp out Main test dataset/test.csv
```

## 🔍 How It Works
### Neural Network Architecture
- **Input Layer:** Takes pixel values as input. ✏️
- **Hidden Layers:** Configurable layers with adjustable neurons and activation functions. 🌀
- **Output Layer:** Outputs probabilities for each class (doodle type). 📊

### Key Concepts
- **Matrix Multiplication:** For forward propagation. ➗✖️
- **Activation Functions:** ReLU, Sigmoid, or custom functions. ⚡
- **Backpropagation:** Calculates gradients using the chain rule. 🔄
- **Gradient Descent:** Updates weights to minimize the loss function. 📉

### Example Workflow
1. **Initialization:** Randomly initialize weights and biases. 🎲
2. **Forward Propagation:** Calculate outputs layer by layer. 🧩
3. **Error Calculation:** Compute the loss (e.g., Mean Squared Error or Cross-Entropy Loss). ❌
4. **Backward Propagation:** Adjust weights using gradients. 🔧
5. **Repeat:** Iterate over multiple epochs until convergence. 🔁
